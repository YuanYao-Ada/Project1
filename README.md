1.What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
I think design and navigation bar is the most challenging one. Working with HTML and CSS is challenging as well but not much more difficult than design. I spent more than 20 hours on this assignment.

2.What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
(1) Change the navigation bar according to the size of the screen.
(2) Change the diplay of the photos according to the size of the screen. The initial display is three rows and three columns. When the screen's width is smaller than 1200px, the display will change to four rows and two columns. When the screen's width is smaller than 600px, there will be only one column.

3.What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
The first thing is to make clean pages. One thing I am proud of is that my navbar will change according to the screen size. Another thing I want to mention is that I really like the color of my pages.

4.Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
(1) Improve the navigation bar. The current navigation bar is very simple. I think it can be improved.
(2) Make the photo page more creative. Now the photos are displayed in a simple way.
(3) Improve the design.

5.How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
I spent at least twenty hours on this assignment. The most time is spent on web design. And a large amount of time is used to make the website more mobile friendly.
